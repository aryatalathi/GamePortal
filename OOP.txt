Following are the OOP concept used in this project : 

1. Encapsulation: 
    Each class encapsulates its data and provides methods to interact with that data. 
    For example, in TicTacToeGame, the board is declared as a private member variable, making it accessible only within the TicTacToeGame class. 
    
2. Abstraction: 
    Each class abstracts away the implementation details and exposes only the essential interfaces for interacting with the game. 
    This allows users to interact with the game objects without knowing the internal workings. 
    For example, in QuizGame and GuessGame, all the questions are declared/stored privately.

3. Inheritance: 
    The TicTacToeGame and SnakeAndLadderGame classes both inherit from the Game base class. 
    This represents an "is-a" relationship, where the derived classes inherit common properties and behaviors from the base class.

4. Constructor: 
    Each class has a constructor (GuessGame, TicTacToeGame, SnakeAndLadderGame, and QuizGame) to initialize their member variables when objects are created. 
    
5. Data Hiding: 
    Access specifiers like private, protected, and public are used to hide the internal details of the classes and control the access to class members.

6. Member Functions: 
    Member functions in each class encapsulate the game logic and provide the necessary operations to play the games.
