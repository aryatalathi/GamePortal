# GamePortal

This project includes a Game Portal.
Games are made for two players where they get specific points at the end of each game to make it fun!

They can play games as many times as they want.

Users can choose a game of their choice and play it.
I have added following 4 games on the Game Portal : 
1. Guess Game 
2. Snake & Ladder 
3. Quiz Game 
4. Tic Tac Toe 


All these games are built using C++ Programming and OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation.
