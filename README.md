# GamePortal

This project includes a Game Portal.
All games are made for two players where they get specific points at the end of each game,
at the end(after playing the games they like, and want to stop), point of players will be compared,
and the winner will be declared.

They can play games as many times as they want.

Users can choose a game of their choice and play it.
I have added following 4 games on the Game Portal : 
1. Guess Game
2. Snake & Ladder
3. Quiz Game
4. Tic Tac Toe


All these games are built using C++ Programming.
