# GamePortal

This project includes a Game Portal.
Games are made for one/two players where they get specific points at the end of each game to make it fun!

They can play games as many times as they want.

Users can choose a game of their choice and play it.
I have added following 4 games on the Game Portal : 
1. Guess Game (Single Player)
2. Snake & Ladder (Double Player)
3. Quiz Game (Single Player)
4. Tic Tac Toe (Double Player)


All these games are built using C++ Programming and is OOP based.
